# QuestionsAndAnswersAPI

## This is the Q&A section of the back end for a retail product page. 

### You can perform GET and POST requests to the questions endpoint at the '/qa/questions/' endpoint. You can also perform GET requests to the answers endpoint at the '/qa/questions/:question_id/answers' endpoint. 

Due to time constraints, other route handlers, such as the POST request route handler to the answers endpoint, and PATCH and PUT request route handlers, have not been implemented yet. They can be implemented later as next steps for the project to complete all of the CRUD operations.

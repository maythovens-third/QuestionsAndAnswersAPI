# QuestionsAndAnswersAPI

### This is the Q&A section of the back end for a retail product page. You can perform GET and POST requests to the questions endpoint at the '/qa/questions/' endpoint. You can also perform GET requests to the answers endpoint at the '/qa/questions/:question_id/answers' endpoint. Other route handlers, such as the POST request route handler to the answers endpoint, and PATCH and PUT request route handlers, can be implemented as next steps for the project to complete all of the CRUD operations.
